## Additional Findings
**Windows 10**
* 248 renameing operations have been logged, seems to encrypt the original file and a 'mtoqpgise' suffix is added. 
* Uses 'wmic  shadowcopy delete' to delete shadow copies.
* Uses QueryValueKey to obtain information from '..MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid' which is often used as a unique identifier for a machine. This specific operations occurs 815 times in the sample. [More Information](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_42991626.html)
* Uses QueryValueKey to open the '..\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider Types\\Type 001' (points to Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider) and '..\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider\\Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider\\' registry key, which is used as the default RSA Full cryptographic service provider (CSP). It supports all of the algorithms of the Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider and all of the same key lengths. It can be used with all versions of CryptoAPI. More information [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/microsoft-strong-cryptographic-provider) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/microsoft-enhanced-cryptographic-provider)
* Uses QueryValueKey to open the '..Microsoft\\Cryptography\\PrivKeyCacheMaxItems' registry key, which specifies the maximum number of private keys that can be cached at one time for a single process. [More Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/private-key-caching-constants#szPRIV_KEY_CACHE_MAX_ITEMS)
* Uses QueryValueKey to open the '..Microsoft\\Cryptography\\PrivKeyCachePurgeIntervalSeconds' registry key, which specifies the maximum age, in seconds, of any cached private key. [More Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/private-key-caching-constants#szPRIV_KEY_CACHE_PURGE_INTERVAL_SECONDS)
* Uses QueryValueKey to open the '..Microsoft\\Cryptography\\PrivateKeyLifetimeSeconds' registry key, which specifies the maximum age, in seconds, of any cached private key. [More Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/private-key-caching-constants#szKEY_CACHE_SECONDS)




**Windows 7**
* 322 renameing operations have been logged, seems to encrypt the original file and a 'rpuse' suffix is added.
* Uses 'wmic  shadowcopy delete' to delete shadow copies.
