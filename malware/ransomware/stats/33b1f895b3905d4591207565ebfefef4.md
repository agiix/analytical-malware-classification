## Additional Findings
**Windows 10**
* Uses QueryValueKey to obtain information from '..MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid' which is often used as a unique identifier for a machine. This specific operations occurs 815 times in the sample. [More Information](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_42991626.html)
* Uses QueryValueKey to retrieve informations about the 'Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider\\Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0' registry key, which defaults to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider. It can be used with all versions of CryptoAPI. [More Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptographic-provider-names)
* No additional indicators could be found, perhaps it evaded further analysis. 


**Windows 7**
* Creats it's own key in '\\REGISTRY\\MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Cryptography'. 
* No additional indicators could be found, perhaps it evaded further analysis.
