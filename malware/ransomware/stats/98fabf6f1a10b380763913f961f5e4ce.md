* Uses QueryValueKey to retrieve informations about the 'Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider\\Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider v1.0' registry key, which defaults to Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider. It can be used with all versions of CryptoAPI. [More Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptographic-provider-names)
