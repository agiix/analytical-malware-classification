## Additional Findings
**Windows 10**
* 849 file renameing operations have been logged, the samples seems to encrypt the original file and adds the '.purge' suffix to it.


**Windows 7**
* 603 file renameing operations have been logged, the samples seems to encrypt the original file and adds the '.purge' suffix to it.
* Uses QueryValueKey to obtain information from '..MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid' which is often used as a unique identifier for a machine. This specific operations occurs 815 times in the sample. [More Information](https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_42991626.html)
* Uses QueryValueKey to open the '..\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider Types\\Type 001' (points to Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider) and '..\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\Defaults\\Provider\\Microsoft Strong Cryptographic Provider\\' registry key, which is used as the default RSA Full cryptographic service provider (CSP). It supports all of the algorithms of the Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider and all of the same key lengths. It can be used with all versions of CryptoAPI.
