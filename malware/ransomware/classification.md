# Ransomware

### Crypto API calls
Detecting API calls to cryptographic functionality is a popular and effective way to detect ransomware behavior. 
Window’s CryptoAPI and its functions CryptEncrypt and CryptHashData are commonly used.

### File deletion/removal
Ransomware tends to copy the content of a file it wants to encrypt to a new file before encrypting it. The original file is then deleted. If a significant amount of user data is deleted, it could indicate ran- somware or wiper malware activity.

### File extension modification
Most ransomware changes the files suffix after encryption. By com- paring the new suffix to a list of suffixes previously used, it may be possible to attribute the sample to a specific ransomware family.
