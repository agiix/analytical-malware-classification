        "description": "Uses encryption to disable a target’s access to its data until a ransom is paid. The victim organization is rendered partially or totally unable to operate until it pays, but there is no guarantee that payment will result in the necessary decryption key or that the decryption key provided will function properly."

    "RAT":{
        "description":"Remote Access Trojans provide the capability to allow covert surveillance or the ability to gain unauthorized access to a system. Remote Access Trojans often mimic similar behaviors of keylogger applications by allowing the automated collection of keystrokes, usernames, passwords, screenshots, browser history, emails, chat lots, etc. They differ from keyloggers in that they provide the capability for an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the system via specially configured communication protocols which are set up upon initial infection of the system."
    },
    "Spyware":{
        "description":"Spyware, once on a system, gathers information about the user, including the sites visited, download history, usernames and passwords, payment information, and emails sent and received. It finds its way on to the system (for example with trojan like techniques) without a user’s knowledge or permission and attaching itself to the operating system. Whatever way spyware manages to get on to the system, the method of operation is generally the same—it runs quietly in the background, maintaining a secret presence, collecting information or monitoring activities in order to trigger malicious activities related to the system and how it is used."
